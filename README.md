# Picture-Sorter
This is a software to sort a large amount of pictures / videos at once into subfolders based on the date they were taken

## Things to change I think
- [ ] rewrite fully in python
- [ ] add handling error for each iteration while getting the folder's data
- [ ] add checbox to delete all folders once they've been emptied (one the files have been moved)
- [ ] rewrite the output console (to fit the rest of the GUI theme)
- [x] ~~use regex for checking sorting/naming types~~
- [ ] use month names instead of numbers (02 -> f√©vrier)
- [x] ~~add more flexible naming types: allow any character AND match the type identifiers: 'bonjour belles <dd> <mm> <yyyy> images' (using regex too)~~
